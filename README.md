# Growbox
So the main idea was to create a grow box for internal plant growing with adjustable climate parameters (light, humidity, temperature). For such  purposes were used: photocell sensor, HDT22 digital humidity-temperature sensor, capacitor,  dc motor, fan, water pump, infrared lamp, breadboard with some wires, Raspberry pi and some python. So photocell sensor is connected with capacitor at the breadboard. By time needed to charge the capacitor, we can define solar insulation level in order to compare it with optimal range for plant growing. If received data is bigger or smaller then extreme values of solar insulating, dc motor (connected to a jalousie) opens/closes (change the angle of) jalousie until photocell gets optimal amount of light. Same deal with HDT22 sensor, when humidity level is less then minimal - water pump start to operate in humidifier, if more than maximum optimal â€“ fan starting to operate. Temperature level can be incriesed by heat of infrared lamp, in order to increase temperature, and decriesed by the same fan I used for dehumidifier purposes.     
In general it could be pretty good solution for those, who seeks for easy way of growing some nice, specific plants.
